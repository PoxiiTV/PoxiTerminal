# Launch a debug nebula instance for ui_probe and print its PID.
#
# It runs a COPY, never target/debug/pebrel.exe itself. Two reasons, both hit:
#
#   1. Windows will not let a running exe be overwritten. Probing the build
#      output directly makes the next `cargo build` die with
#      "linking with x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc failed", while the real cause
#      (file in use) is buried under a wall of mingw .drectve warnings.
#
#   2. The probe instance must be disposable, and the user's own Nebula window
#      must never be collateral. Different exe paths remove any temptation to
#      clean up by image name. NEVER run `taskkill /IM pebrel.exe` here: the
#      active Claude Code session may itself be hosted in a Nebula window.
#
# conpty.dll and OpenConsole.exe are copied alongside: the Windows PTY backend
# looks for them next to the exe, and the instance cannot open a shell without
# them.
